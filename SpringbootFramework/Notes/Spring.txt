For Spring we need to understand two concepts
IoC(Inverstion of Control)
- It means letting a framework or external system manage the flow and creation of objects in your
program, instead of you doing it manually.
- Think of it like hiring someone to cook for you—you just tell them what you want, and they handle the rest!
- To achieve this spring have IoC container that takes care of all the object creation and destruction.
All the objects are inside this container. Spring is responsible for creating Objects.

DI(Dependency Injection)
- Dependency Injection (DI) is a way to give an object its needed dependencies without the object having to
create them itself.
-It’s like someone handing you the ingredients to make a sandwich, instead of you having to go to the store and
buy them yourself!
-DI allows you to inject the required dependencies (like Engine) into your class (like Car) from outside, making
the code more flexible, maintainable, and testable.
