MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces and structuring
web applications. MVC divides an application into three interconnected components, promoting a clean separation of concerns
that makes the application more modular, maintainable, and testable.

Components of MVC
Model: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application.
View: The View is the UI layer that presents data to the user.
Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
