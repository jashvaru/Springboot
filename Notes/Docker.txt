What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and management of applications by using
containerization technology. Docker enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight,
portable containers that can run consistently across various environments.

A Docker container is created from a Docker image.
Analogy:
Think of a Docker image as a recipe (instructions for creating something) and the Docker container as the dish prepared
from that recipe.
