-docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...] - The docker run command is used to create and start a container from a
Docker image. It can also include options to configure the container’s behavior, such as networking, volume mounting,
environment variables, etc.

-docker ps -a [OPTIONS] - The docker ps -a command is used to list all containers on your system, including those that
are currently running, stopped, or exited. This is particularly useful for checking the status and history of containers.

-docker images [OPTIONS] [REPOSITORY[:TAG]] - The docker images command is used to list all the Docker images stored on
your local machine. This includes images that have been pulled from a registry or built locally.

-docker rm [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...] - This command removes one or more containers from your system.
-f or --force: Force removal of a running container by stopping it first.
-v or --volumes: Remove any volumes associated with the container.

-docker rmi [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGE...] - This command removes one or more Docker images from your system.
-f or --force: Force the removal of an image, even if it is being used by stopped containers.

-docker search [OPTIONS] TERM - This is used to search for Docker images on the Docker Hub or any other configured
registry. It returns a list of images matching the search term, along with metadata such as description, stars, and
whether the image is official.

-docker pull [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG|@DIGEST] - This is used to download a Docker image from a remote registry (e.g., Docker
Hub or a private registry) to your local machine. This command ensures that you have the specified image locally before
you can use it.

-docker create [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...] - This is used to create a new container from a specified image without
starting it. This is useful when you want to set up a container with specific configurations before starting it.

-docker start [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...] - This is used to start one or more stopped containers. It allows you
 to run a container that has already been created (using docker create or docker run).

-docker stop [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...] - This is used to stop one or more running containers. It sends a SIGTERM
signal to the container, allowing it to gracefully shut down. If the container does not stop within a grace period
(default: 10 seconds), it sends a SIGKILL signal to forcefully terminate it.

-docker pause [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...] - command is used to pause one or more running containers, temporarily
suspending all processes inside the container. This works by sending a SIGSTOP signal to the container’s processes,
which effectively freezes them. Pausing a container is useful when you want to halt its activity temporarily without
fully stopping it, and you can resume the container later.

-docker run -it - This command is used to start a new Docker container in interactive mode with a pseudo-TTY
(teletypewriter). This is useful when you want to interact with the container in real time, such as running commands
inside the container or accessing a shell.

-docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...] - This command allows you to run a command in a running Docker container.
It is particularly useful for interacting with containers that are already up and running without stopping them or
starting a new container instance.
-i: Keep STDIN open, allowing interactive input.
-t: Allocate a pseudo-TTY (terminal), so the command runs in a terminal-like interface.
-d: Run the command in the background (detached mode).
--user: Specify a username or UID to run the command as.

-docker cp [OPTIONS] SOURCE DESTINATION - The docker cp command is used to copy files or directories between a Docker
container and the host machine. It works similarly to the Linux cp command but allows copying across the container boundary.

-docker commit [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [REPOSITORY[:TAG]] - The docker commit command is used to create a new Docker image
from a container's current state. This is useful when you want to save changes made to a running or stopped container
and turn it into a reusable image.
-a or --author: Specify the author of the new image.
-m or --message: Add a commit message for the image.
--change: Apply Dockerfile instructions (e.g., CMD, ENV) while creating the new image.
--pause: Default is true. Pauses the container during the commit process to ensure a consistent state.
