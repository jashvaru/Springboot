ECS - Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by Amazon Web
Services (AWS). It allows you to run, scale, and manage containerized applications in the AWS cloud without having to
manage the underlying infrastructure.

Cluster - In Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service), a cluster is a logical grouping of resources where your tasks and
services run. It serves as the foundation for deploying and managing containerized applications in ECS.

Task - In the context of Amazon ECS, a task is a single running instance of a task definition, which defines how
containers should run, including the container image, CPU, memory, networking, and other settings.

ECR - Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container registry provided by AWS that allows you
to store, manage, and deploy container images securely. It works seamlessly with Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and other
container orchestration tools.
