Monolithic - A monolithic architecture is a traditional software development approach where an application is built
as a single, unified unit. It typically includes all the components—such as the user interface (UI), business logic,
and data access layers—packaged together into one executable or deployable unit. This design is commonly used for
applications that run on a single platform.

Microservices - It is a architecture is a modern software design approach where an application is composed of small,
independently deployable services that work together to deliver the application's overall functionality. Each service
typically focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs,
often using protocols like HTTP, REST, or messaging queues.
