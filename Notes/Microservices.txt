Monolithic - A monolithic architecture is a traditional software development approach where an application is built
as a single, unified unit. It typically includes all the components—such as the user interface (UI), business logic,
and data access layers—packaged together into one executable or deployable unit. This design is commonly used for
applications that run on a single platform.
