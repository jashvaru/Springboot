-You can directly get xml maven code from Google to add dependency to your project
-Maven have a concept of effective pom. While executing it will read xml added from the effective pom
-If you don't want to write pom.xml from scratch we can make use of maven Arch Type. Arch type are predefined/user created templates

and download that dependency. Ideally big companies have their own set of dependencies for safety and which are not vulnerable.
