There are way to configure spring projects
-xml -java code -annotations

-xml
-In this project we will be creating spring project with xml configuration of the spring bean
-ApplicationContext applicationContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("spring.xml");
    when above line of code executes it checks the classes mentioned in xml and creates bean for the classes.

Scope of Beans in Spring
-Singleton
-Prototype

-At the time when spring loads the application context only beans with scope as singleton will get created and it can be
used anywhere in the code.
-Bean with scope as prototype will get created at the time of getBean() and not on the load of application context
